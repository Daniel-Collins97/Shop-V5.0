# Shop-V5.0

This Project was completed as part of the Programming II module in first year. The project simulates a shop which allows the user to to multiple things such as Adding and Deleting Products, Listing cheapest Products, Displaying the average product unit cost and saving and loading a list of products from an XML file. This product also uses ArrayLists.

### Prerequisites

For this project, I used the Intellij IDEA Java IDE, which allowed me to write the programme and also run the code, including running the tests

### The Project Contents

This project involved creating a user-friendly "Shop" within the Intellij Workspace. 
I used 3 core objects, "Driver", "Product",  and "Store". The "Driver" class holds the code for running the application and controlling the menu selection. It also holds the code for Adding a Product, Editing a Product, and Deleting a Product. The "Product" class holds the code for creating a new Product Object, including the Constructor, Setters, and Getters. The "Store" class contains code for Adding Existing Products to an array list, and using this list to List the Cheapest/Most Expensive Products, List the Producs the Store is currently stocking, get the Average Product Cost throughout the Store, List the Products Above/Below a certain Price, and the Loading and Saving to XML file operations.

I have inplemented multiple CRUD elements to this project, as well as some general user operations;
- Adding a Product
- Listing a Product
- Updating a Product
- Deleting a Product
- Listing the Cheapest/Most Expensive Product
- Listing the Products the Store is currently stocking
- Displaying the Average Product Cost throughtout the Store
- Listing the Porducts Above/Below a certain Price
- Saving the current list of Products to an XML File
- Loading a pre-populated list of Products from an XML File
